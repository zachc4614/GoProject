Changes today to main.go:

    Password Generation: Implemented a complex password generator in the existing main.go code, ensuring passwords are at least 12-15 characters long, including a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.

    Error Handling for Missing Configuration File: Added error handling code to ensure the client tool gracefully handles situations where the configuration file is missing.

    TLS Communication with Backend Database: Integrated TLS communication in the client tool by configuring the server certificate, CA certificate, and private key, ensuring secure communication with the backend database.
